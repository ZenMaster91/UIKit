This repository includes all code performed during the subjects of the University of Oviedo. Anyway, to give some structure it's presented as an API called willyOS. The structure of this API might be different from the structure followed during the courses because it refers more to the big picture of the degree than to the individual courses. Because of this reason the structure is the following:

```php
 - willyOS
   - SDK
     - XXXKit
       - ...
     - Foundation
       - ...
     
 - test
   - ... Same structure
```

> ### Note
> 
> The tests that come with willyOS are written using the libary JUnit. After the installation remember that you have to import the `JUnit` at the beginning of your test class.
> ```java
> import org.junit.Test;
> ```
