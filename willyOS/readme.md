## AppKit  ```beta```
Development kit for apps. Manages the interaction between the user and the application.

## DBKit
Databases development kit. Used to manage connections between persistence databases and the system.

## Foundation
The Foundation framework provides a base layer of functionality for apps and frameworks, including data storage and persistence, text processing, date and time calculations, sorting and filtering, and networking. The classes, protocols, and data types defined by Foundation are used throughout the SDK.

## MathsKit ```beta```


## SecKit
Use the Security framework to protect information, establish trust, and control access to software. Broadly, security services support these goals:
Establish a user’s identity (authentication) and then selectively grant access to resources (authorization).
Secure data, both on disk and in motion across a network connection.
Ensure the validity of code to be executed for a particular purpose.
Rely on the Security framework when you need cryptography in your app.

## UIKit
The UIKit framework provides the required infrastructure for your apps. It provides the window and view architecture for implementing your interface, the event handling infrastructure for delivering Multitouch and other types of input to your app, and the main run loop needed to manage interactions among the user, the system, and your app. Other features offered by the framework include animation support, document support, drawing and printing support, information about the current device, text management and display, search support, accessibility support, app extension support, and resource management.

## WebKit
WebKit provides a set of classes to display web content in windows, and implements browser features such as following links when clicked by the user, managing a back-forward list, and managing a history of pages recently visited. WebKit greatly simplifies the complicated process of loading webpages—that is, asynchronously requesting web content from an HTTP server where the response may arrive incrementally, in random order, or partially due to network errors. WebKit also simplifies the process of displaying that content which can contain various MIME types, and compound frame elements each with their own set of scroll bars.
